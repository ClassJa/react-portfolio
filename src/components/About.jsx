            I am an avid learner with interests in design, creation, and development. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I seek out various opportunities to elevate my understanding in fields that I find fascinating (this has been ever-growing). I am currently delving into the topics of web development and game development.

            I plan to continue in my personal pursuits while integrating them with my personal values of authenticity and many more.
