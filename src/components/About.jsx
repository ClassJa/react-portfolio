            I am an avid learner with interests in design, creation, and development. I seek out various opportunities to elevate my understanding in fields that I find fascination in which is ever-growing. I am currently delving into the topics of web development and game development. And plan to continue in my personal pursuits while marrying them with my personal values of authenticity and much more.
